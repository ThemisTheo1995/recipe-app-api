curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.3.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```
- Set the correct permissions so that the `docker compose` command is executable:

## How to spin up local server.
- Spin up the containers for local development:
```bash
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

That's everything you shall need to run this project locally at http://0.0.0.0:8000/

## How to spin up the stage server - mirroring production

- Stop any running containers:
```bash
sudo docker compose down
```
- Check no containers are running:
```bash
sudo docker ps -a
```
> Should be empty list
- Run docker-compose-deploy composer:
```bash
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-deploy.yml up
```

You should see the spawned uWSGI workers up and running. If so, your app is ready for deployment.

P.S. Application is currently in production/live, feel free to ask for the public IP.
